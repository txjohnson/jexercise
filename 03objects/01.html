<h1>Objects</h1>
<p>
Variables can be combined into an object. An object is like a dictionary of key/value pairs. These pairs are called properties. In object oriented programming, the key is called a member or member name of an object.</p>
<p>
Objects are created using <code>{}</code> notation. The value of each member can be a primitive Javascript type or another object.</p>
<pre>
let obj = { name: "Joe", age: 99 };
</pre>
<p>The above declares an object that has two properties: a name and an age.
</p>
<p>Create an object below. Complete the assignment.</p>
