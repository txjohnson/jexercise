<h1>Objects 3.2</h1>
<p>
Variables can be combined into an object. An object is like a dictionary of key/value pairs. These pairs are called properties. In object oriented programming, the key is called a member or member name of an object.
<p>
Objects are created using <code>{}</code> notation. The value of each member can be a primitive Javascript type or another object.</p>
<pre>
let obj = { name: "Joe", age: 99 };
obj.name  // gives 'Joe'
</pre>
<p>The above declares an object that has two properties: a name and an age.
The value of a property can be accessed using the <code>.</code> accessor notation and then providing a member name.
</p>
<p>Access the address member of person.</p>
<pre>
    const person = {
        name: "Dr Who",
        address: "somewhere in time"
    };
</pre>

	let code = 'const person = { name: "Dr Who", address: "somewhere in time" };' + getUserCode ();
    let score = 0;

	clearMessages ();
	score += badIf(test (code) !== 'somewhere in time', "Nope. Try again.");
	score += goodIf(test (code) === 'somewhere in time', "Looks good!");
	badIf (score === 0, "Nope. Try again");
}
