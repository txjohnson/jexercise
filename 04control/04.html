<h1>Control Structures 4.4</h1>
<p>
Control structures let you specify which block of code is executed or how many times execution will occur.
<pre>
let i = 55;
if (i > 64) { console.log ("too fast") }
else if (i < 45) { console .log ("too slow") }
else { console.log ("ok") }
</pre>
<p>The above only outputs "too fast" if <code>i</code> is more than <code>64</code>, outputs "too slow" if <code>i</code> is less than <code>45</code> and otherwise outputs "ok". This is a called a <b>general mutually exclusive condition</b>. This type of condition has several parts: <code>if</code> that marks the start of a conditional statement, a test expression in <code>()</code> a block of code to execute in <code>{}</code> if the test turns out to be true, several <code>else if</code> fragments, and a possible <code>else</code> clause with a block in <code>{}</code> for when all else fails.</p>
<p>Logically, this is like a multi-way fork in the road. Only one path an be taken at a time. Each path is guarded by a test. If the test succeeds, then the path is taken. If no test succeeds, and there is a final <code>else</code> path, then that one is taken.</p>
<p>Given a variable <code>c</code> that contains an integer between 0 and 1, set another variable called <code>bit</code> to either <code>'zero'</code> or <code>'one'</code> depending on the value of c.</p>
