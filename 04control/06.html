<h1>Control Structures 4.6</h1>
<p>
Control structures let you specify which block of code is executed or how many times execution will occur.
<pre>
let numbers = [5, 2, 8, 9];
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    sum += numbers [i]
}
console.log(sum)
</pre>
<p>This is an example of a <code>for</code> loop. A <code>for</code> loop repeats a block of code a (usually) predetermined number of times. The above example loops over the values in a list, building up a sum along the way. Finally the sum is written to the console. The loop is bounded because the number of iterations depends directly on the length of the list.</p>
<p>The loop variable <code>i</code> is declared in the loop head.It only exists for the duration of the list. Using this variable that changes on each repetition, i is used to index into the numbers array and obtain the value at each index.</p>
<p>What is the value of sum at the end of this loop.</p>
<pre>
let sum = 0
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    sum += i
}
