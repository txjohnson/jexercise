<h1>Control Structures 4.10</h1>
<p>
Control structures let you specify which block of code is executed or how many times execution will occur.
<pre>
let numbers = [5, 2, 8, 9];
let i = 0;
let sum = 0;
while (i < numbers.length) {
    sum += numbers [i]
    i += 1;
}
console.log(sum)
</pre>
<p>This is an example of a <code>while</code> loop. A <code>while</code> loop repeats a block as long as a condition is true. The above example loops over the values in a list, building up a sum along the way. Finally the sum is written to the console. Compare this with the <code>for</code> version in a previous exercise. In the most general case, we don't know how many times a while loop will repeat.</p>
<p>A <code>while</code> loop has two parts: the <code>while</code> that declares what follows will be a loop, a condition that determines whether or not the block should repeat in <code>()</code>, and the body, enclosed in <code>{}</code>, that will be executed 0 or more times.
</p>
<p>Given a function <code>getNum()</code>that produces a sequence of 0s and 1s, write a while that will count 0s but stop as soon as it receives a 1. The variable <code>count</code> is provied. Make count go up by 1 as long as a 0 is received.</p>
