<h1>Control Structures 4.8</h1>
<p>
Control structures let you specify which block of code is executed or how many times execution will occur.
<pre>
let numbers = [5, 2, 8, 9];
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    sum += numbers [i]
}
console.log(sum)
</pre>
<p>
A <code>for</code> loop has three parts: the <code>for</code> that declares what follows will be a loop, a head that sets the behavior of the loop inside the <code>()</code>, and the body, enclosed in <code>{}</code>, that will be executed 0 or more times.
</p>
<p>
The head has a number of parts as well. A semicolon (<code>;</code>) separates each section. The first part sets the initial state of the loop -- by declaring and initializing a variable or using a variable in scope. The second part, sets the termination condition. The final part specifies how the variable will change on each iteration.
</p>
<p>
We can add values to a list using push.
</p>
<pre>
let list = [];
list .push (5)
</pre>
<p>
By the end of execution list has become <code>[5]</code>.
</p>
<p>Given an array <code>a</code> of numbers, create a variable named <code>avg</code> and assign it the average of the numbers in <code>l</code>. You will need to write a <code>for</code> loop to collect the sum. Remember the average is the sum of a list divided by its length. (Dont forget: The length of every array can obtained by the <code>length</code> property. See the arrays section.)</p>
