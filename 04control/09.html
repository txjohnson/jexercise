<h1>Control Structures</h1>
<p>
Control structures let's you specify which block of code is executed or how many times execution will occur.
<pre>
let numbers = [5, 2, 8, 9];
let i = 0;
let sum = 0;
while (i < numbers.length) {
    sum += numbers [i]
    i += 1;
}
console.log(sum)
</pre>
<p>This is an example of a <code>while</code> loop. A <code>while</code> loop repeats a block as long as a condition is true. The above example loops over the values in a list, building up a sum along the way. Finally the sum is written to the console. Compare this with the <code>for</code> version in a previous exercise. In the most general case, we don't know how many times a while loop will repeat.</p>
<p>The loop variable <code>i</code> is outside of the loop. While loops don't necessarily need a loop version. This one happens to have one. Note that it is up to the loop body to get things ready for the next iteration of the loop.</p>
<p>What is the value of <code>i</code> by the end of this loop?</p>
<pre>
let numbers = [4, 2, 10, 6, 8, 9];
let i = 0
while (numbers[i] < 10) {
    i += 1;
}
</pre>
