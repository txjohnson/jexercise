<h1>Control Structures</h1>
<p>
Control structures let's you specify which block of code is executed or how many times execution will occur.
<pre>
let i = 55;
if (i > 64) { console.log ("too fast") }
else { console.log ("ok") }
</pre>
<p>The above only outputs "too fast" if <code>i</code> is more than <code>64</code>. Otherwise it will output "ok". This is a called a <b>mutually exclusive condition</b>. This type of condition has, at least, four parts: <code>if</code> that marks the start of a conditional statement, a test expression in <code>()</code> a block of code to execute in <code>{}</code> if the test turns out to be true, an <code>else</code> clause that has a block of code in <code>{}</code> for the case where the test fails to be true.</p>
<p>Logically, this is like a fork in the road. Only one path an be taken at a time. The path taken depends on the answer to the test. If the test is true, one path is taken. The other path is taken if the test turns out false.</p>
<p>What is <code>i</code>in this example?</p>
<pre>
let i;
let j = 4;
if (j > 10) { i = 'cat' }
else { i = 'dog' }
</pre>
