<h1>Control Structures</h1>
<p>
Control structures let's you specify which block of code is executed or how many times execution will occur.
<pre>
let numbers = [5, 2, 8, 9];
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    sum += numbers [i]
}
console.log(sum)
</pre>
<p>
A <code>for</code> loop has three parts: the <code>for</code> that declares what follows will be a loop, a head that sets the behavior of the loop inside the <code>()</code>, and the body, enclosed in <code>{}</code>, that will be executed 0 or more times.
</p>
<p>
The head has a number of parts as well. A semicolon (<code>;</code>) separates each section. The first part sets the initial state of the loop -- by declaring and initializing a variable or using a variable in scope. The second part, sets the termination condition. The final part specifies how the variable will change on each iteration.
</p>
<p>How many times does this loop repeat?</p>
<pre>
let sum = 0
for (let i = 0; i !== 10; i += 2) {
    sum += i
}
